# 1. In a file named "palindrome.py," create a program that prompts the
# user for a word or phrase and checks if it is a palindrome.
# A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters
# that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter casing).
# Output "True" if it's a palindrome, and "False" if it's not.

# 2. In a file named "calculator.py," implement a basic calculator program that allows
# the user to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.
# Prompt the user for the operation they want to perform, and then for the two numbers
# to operate on. Output the result of the operation.

# 3. In a file named "guess_the_number.py," implement a simple number guessing game.
# Generate a random number between 1 and 100, and have the user guess the number.
# Provide hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until they guess the correct number.
# Output the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.


# name = "bitcamp"
# guess = ""
# counter = []

# while True:
#     # counter.append(guess)
#     # print("You did not guess the name!")
#     guess = input("Please guess the name: ").lower()
#     if guess != name:
#         print("Wrong name!")
#         counter.append(guess)
#     else:
#         print("You guessed the name!")
#         break

#     # counter += 1
# print(len(counter))



# for i in range(20):
#     if i == 15:
#         break
#     print(i)
