# 1. In a file named "palindrome.py," create a program that prompts the
# user for a word or phrase and checks if it is a palindrome.
# A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters
# that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter casing).
# Output "True" if it's a palindrome, and "False" if it's not.

  # # word = "bitcamp"
    # # range(7,-1,-1)
    # for i in range(len(word)-1,-1,-1):
    #     new_word.append(word[i])
    # print("".join(new_word))
    # "note"
    # print(new_word)


# def main():
#     word = input("Check if your phrase is palindrome: ")
#     if isPalindrome(word):
#         print("Your word is PALINDROME! ")
#     else:
#         print("This word is not palindrome! ")

# def isPalindrome(word):
#     reversed_word = word[::-1]
#     if reversed_word == word:
#         return True
#     else:
#         return False
#     # დააბრუნოს ან True ან False

# main()

# my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

# print(my_list[::-1])


# for i in reversed(range(4)):
#     print(i)
